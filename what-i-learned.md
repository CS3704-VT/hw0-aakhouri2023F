### What I Learned with the GitHub Starter Course

With the _GitHub Starter Course_ on **HW0**, I learned more about how GitHub is used in the software industry, such as with visualizing data and video game development. 

I also learned more about the GitHub flow, as I was familiar with it through personal experience, but got more context and detail. I was familiar with repositories, cloning, and pushing and pulling. However, I wasn't familiar with branches and forks until now. I also didn't have much experience with markdown language.
